I found a link where someone has done this assigment. We can use this if we are 
unsure what to do. Here is the link: https://github.com/Adrianbakke/Mayhem
OBS: DELETE BEFORE HAND-IN (LOL)

Here are all the resources I used to create stuff.
RESOURCES:
This was to create obstacle with image sprite.
http://kidscancode.org/lessons/

This is for creating player sprite.

We don't need to create a parent class with 'class parent(Sprite)'. Instead, 
all of our objects will directly inherit from pygame.sprite.Sprite.
So player(pygame.sprite.Sprite), etc. 

We need to make a config.py file that contains all variables and their values.
For example; 
screen = ()
FUEl = 100
etc.

Let's also make .py files for each stuff. Such as obstacle.py, player.py and etc.


Checklist:
I have created obstacle with an image of an asteroid in the middle of screen. DONE
Next is to create a player class. 
Next is to draw two players and allow them to controll.
Next is to make collision with screen borders and asteroid obstacle.
