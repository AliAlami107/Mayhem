
'if now - self.last_shot > LASER_RATE:
    self.last_shot = now'
Explanation of the above line:
1. 'now' is a timestamp of the current time 
2. 'self.last_shot' is a variable that stores what time it was when the last bullet was fired.
3. When the player is first created, 'self.last_shot' is assigned the value of 0, because a laser has
yet to be fired.
4. When the user click shoot button, the current time is compared to the time when the last bullet was fired.
If more than 150 milliseconds have lapsed between the current time and the time when the last laser was fired,
then a new laser is fired.
5. When a new laser is fired, 'self.last_shot' is reassigned the value of the current time ('now'), 
so that we can loop back to number 4 above in order to decide when to fire the next laser.
